- Search competition communities, check walls for competitions, reposts these posts and join communities

### Requirements for building and running
- Java 8
- Gradle 2.8 and latest
- an account in vk.com that is not a pity to lose (admins are struggling with fake accounts and it can be banned)

### How to build, configure and run
For **building the project** use Gradle. Go to the root project directory and run `gradle dist` command. It will generate zip archive in *build\dist* directory. Extract it somewhere and script is almost ready for running (just need to link it with your VK account and setup some properties).

Also there is ability to deploy the bot to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). This process is described [here](https://gist.github.com/last-khajiit/b6fa4eef443d3d753fce). 

Now about the **configuration**.
First, you need to have an account in vk.com, which you'll use for running the script. I would recommend to use an account that is not a pity to lose, because it can be banned for "strange activity".
The next thing you need to do - to configure some script properties. Go to *conf* directory and find there *vkb.properties* file. Here is an example of configured properties - [vkb.properties](https://gist.github.com/last-khajiit/d5a4e2c6b40104d88e45). There are five **required properties**:

-  *current.user.id* - identification number of your account.
-  *application.id* - identification number of application (it's used for API requests to vk.com).
-  *access.token* - the key that is used for access your application to vk.com API.
- *communities.search.words* - comma-separated list of key words, which will be used for searching of competition communities (e.g. *competition,gifts,prizes*).
-  *post.classification.model* - the model that allow identify competition posts.

Full list of properties, descriptions and example values you can find [here](https://github.com/last-khajiit/vkb/blob/master/properties.md).
